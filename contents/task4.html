        <p>I have chosen to create design system elements following Microsoft's "Fluent 2", but for a fabricated
            Outdoors Company.</p>
        <p>For atomic design components from atom to molecule, I will be going through the stages of creating a
            <u>form</u> using the guidelines Fluent 2 provides.

        <h2>Atom - Colors + Shape</h2>
        <div class="carousel">
            <div class="slide">
                <img src="images/atomsDesign.png" class="imgClick">
            </div>
        </div>

        </p>
        <p>I found a color palette from Coolors.co that I thought I could work with and had the idea of an outdoors
            company when I saw the green. I made sure there was a presence of a light color for background and a darker
            color for "Semantics" as mentioned by Fluent.
        </p>
        <p>I found an Icon to fit the company, and two fonts I could use, one as a default easily readable font and the
            other as a more interesting more unique logo related font.
        </p>

        <h2>Molecule - Inputs (Text/Button)</h2>
        <div class="carousel">
            <div class="slide">
                <img src="images/moleculesDesign.png" class="imgClick">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>For the forms components I followed the guideline of rectangles being the basic shape for most components and
            the example of a login form from microsoft. I also took inspiration from what is common in a lot of forms
            with a less saturated color for placeholder text and a way to tell which textbox you are in (In this case a
            changing underline color)</p>

        <h2>Organism/Template - Form (Layout/Spacing)</h2>
        <div class="carousel">
            <div class="slide">
                <img src="images/organismDesign.png" class="imgClick">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>I decided to add the Icon to the form and made the header text my "Special" font (Bernard MT Condensed). I
            felt this would make the form feel more attached to the brand rather than a copy pasted one, and thought it
            tied in well to the color scheme.</p>

        <h2>Page - Login Screen</h2>
        <div class="carousel">
            <button onclick="plusDivs(-1, 0,'atom')">&#10094;</button>
            <button onclick="plusDivs(1, 0,'atom')">&#10095;</button>
            <div class="slide atom">
                <img src="images/pageReference.png" class="imgClick">
                <p class="imgDesc">Page Reference</p>
            </div>
            <div class="slide atom">
                <img src="images/pageDesign.png" class="imgClick">
                <p class="imgDesc">Page Designed</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>I decided to keep the site as simplistic as possible, similarly to Microsoft's webiste, as in my opinion, as
            complexity increases, so does the difficulty to maintain a polished or even pleasing aesthetic. </p>
        <p>I followed the layout many websites use with the Logo on the left of the nav bar, followed by the websites
            outer catagories, with optional or extra features stuck to the right side.</p>
        <p>I opted for a shadow on the form to make it more pronounced without the harsh edge of a border, again
            inspired from Microsoft's clean simplistic layout, and chose a very light gradient background for the same
            reason.</p>

        <p>Creating a poster from a design system designed for UI is quite difficult as generally Posters are generally
            more creative or artistic but I think I did relatively okay.</p>
        <p>I added flat colored trees onto a flat color background to maintain simplicity but also provide something a
            little more interesting for a poster format. And followed my form design in adding shadows </p>
        <p>For the background of the sale items I did a bit of experimenting over shapes and shadows, initially having a
            rectangle with a curved top and seperate colored section for the pricing. I decided a seperate color for the
            prices seperated them too much from the item.</p>
        <p>For the next two versions I used shadows, similarly to before with the form page to seperate the content from
            the background without a harsh change. However in version 2 I think the light background with the shadow
            caused too harsh of a border so I darkened the background of the cards.</p>
        <p>In version three, I decided that the light background made the items hard to see so switched the colors back
            around, and to deal with the harsh shadow border I changed it's color to a slightly lighter green. I also
            curved the edges as the light colored squares seemed to look a little harsh from a distance</p>

        <p>I found this perfect image that matched my outdoors company and had a nice frame for a quote to sit
            in
            between the mountains. I also added a thick green border just inside the edge of the image to give
            it a
            little more framing.</p>
